Solutions
Cluster 1
What if we give online training to graduates as a way of up skilling and upgrading their current skill set?
What if we get trainers to create content for creatives on the platform?
What if we offer credible content and certificates that are trusted in the field?
What if we offer career changers  an opportunity to gain these skills if they need to diversify?
What if we offer graduates soft, transferable and life skills?


Cluster 2
What if we offer career guidance and help them get into institutions that are great for the career path they choose?
What if we partner with institutions and profile their best performing graduates so they can get direct apprenticeship opportunities with partner companies?
