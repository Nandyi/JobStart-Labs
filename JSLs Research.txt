Young people struggling to find jobs after they leave school is still a persistent problem. The country is not able to absorb all new entrants to the job market or reduce their entry into the informal market. Creating wage jobs for the youth is critical to help reduce poverty and income inequality in the country.
Key Points
* One in four young people are not in employment, education, or training.
* One in two young women with high school education or less are not in employment, education, or training.
* Creating wage jobs for the youth is critical to help reduce poverty and income inequality in the country.
* Active labor market programs encourage employment creation and employability of workers, increase their earning capacity, and enhance integration into the productive workforce.
Youth must be at least a high school graduate with 0- 12 month’s work experience. They may not be currently employed or are enrolled in school or in any training, but actively seeking work. 
ILO Research
Skills development strategies are high on the priority list of countries in all stages of development, for at least three reasons:
* Skills matching : to better forecast and match the provision of skills, both in terms of relevance and quality, with labour market needs;
* Skills upgrading : to adjust skills development programmes and institutions to technological developments and changes in labour markets so that workers and enterprises can move from shrinking, low-productivity economic sectors and professions to expanding, high-productivity sectors and occupations. Such adaptation requires permanent and regular re-skilling, skills upgrading and lifelong learning for workers to maintain their employability and enterprises to remain competitive; and
* Skills for society : to build up capabilities and knowledge systems within the economy and society which induce and maintain a sustainable process of economic and social development. 
The ILO's work on skills development has in recent years focused primarily on three areas:
* linking training to current labour market needs as well as anticipating and building competencies for the jobs of the future;
* building quality apprenticeship systems and incorporating core skills into training for young people; and expanding access to employment-related training in rural communities to improve livelihoods, and reduce poverty; and
* equipping women and men to work in the formal economy.40
