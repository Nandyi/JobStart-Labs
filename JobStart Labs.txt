Enhancing the employability of graduates by providing them with the skills they need to enter and thrive in the modern workforce and paid internships with private sector employers.


Problem Statement:
Uganda has one of the fastest growing populations in the world currently at 47million according to world population review with more than half the population being young. A 2008 World bank report says Uganda is among the countries with the youngest population yet still with the highest youth unemployment rate at 83%.


With the high number of education institutions releasing youth into the workforce every year, the high growth rate of the labor force poses a challenge to the economy of the country. According to the 2011/2012 budget of Uganda, the Ministry of finance recognized that the economy can only absorb 20% of its growth.


Some of the major causes of unemployment are lack of employable skills, lack of access to resources, over emphasis on experience, inadequate job matching, lack of apprenticeship schemes and limited social networks. Consequently, young people are forced to find alternatives to survive and generate income turning to criminal activities, sex and drug industries hence increase in the crime rate.


There are a number of youth programs and recruitment hubs currently trying to solve this issue though have a limited reach and too are generic..
Programs include: Fontes foundation youth program, Pekee educators academy, Kafeero foundation, Mengo youth development link, Andela, the ELA program by BRAC, Upskill, media challenge initiative
